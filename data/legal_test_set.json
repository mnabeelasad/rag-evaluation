    "question": "What was the Supreme Court's 'holding' in Ashcroft v. Iqbal regarding the standard for pleading?",
    "contexts": [
      "Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009): This case further refined the pleading standard set forth in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly. The Court held that a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' The Court clarified that this 'plausibility standard' is not a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. It articulated a two-pronged approach: 1) A court must accept all factual allegations as true, but is 'not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.' 2) The court must then determine whether the well-pleaded factual allegations 'plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.' Conclusory statements of law or 'mere recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements' are not sufficient."
    ],
    "ground_truth_answer": "In Ashcroft v. Iqbal, the Supreme Court held that to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must state a 'plausible' claim for relief. This means the complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations (not just legal conclusions) that, when accepted as true, allow the court to reasonably infer that the defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct. Mere conclusory statements are insufficient."
